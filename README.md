# Condition Based Maintenance Fault Database for Testing of Diagnostic and Prognostics Algorithms
Data Assembled and Prepared on behalf of South Ural State University

## Bearing Fault Dataset
A bearing fault dataset has been provided to facilitate research into bearing analysis. The dataset comprises data from a bearing test rig.

The linear and angular signals of all five bearings were collected with a sampling frequency of 31.175 kHz with the system operating at 1200 rpm (i.e. at 20 Hz).

The data set comprises the following
- normal condition
- fault in inner race
- fault in outer race
- fault in ball
- combination fault

**Note:** The data is stored in a [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) double-precision, binary format *.mat file. The data structure holds vectors of linear and angular acceleration data.
